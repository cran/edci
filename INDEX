edge detection:

  edgepoints	   detection of edge points in noisy images based on 
		   the Difference of two M-Kernel-Estimates

  eplist	   convert matrices returned by edgepoints into lists


regression clustering:

  oregMclust       compute orthogonal regression clusters based on
		   redescending M-estimatiors 

  regparm	   transform the representation of regression lines

  circMclust       compute circular clusters

  deldupMclust	   delete clusters differing only by rounding errors

  bestMclust	   choose 'best' out of found clusters

  projMclust	   calculate number of observations projected to each
		   found cluster 

  envMclust	   count observation lying in a neighbourhood of clusters
